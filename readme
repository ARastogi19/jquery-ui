A fork of jQuery UI to push development of accessibility within the Tabs widget.

This is a development version with basic integration. All features should be supported but please check todo list below.



ToDo:

* Blur temporally disabled cause of massive usability issues. 
	* check when "blur 4" is needed 
* virtual buffer update needed?
* aria disabled for disable option/method
